            <p>At dawn, Mount Kenya glowed pink above silent forests, whispering ancient secrets to climbers who listened closely, finding courage, humility, and wonder etched into its rugged, icy peaks of Africa.

            <p>In Canada’s vast forests, towering pines whisper through cold northern winds, while hidden lakes mirror endless skies, and wandering wildlife leaves quiet stories pressed gently into mossy earth at twilight.
